title: Get Your Sass In Line - Tips and Strategies For Teams
category: blog
teaser: This week I spoke at the inaugural meeting of the PDX Sass and Front-end Meetup that I have been organizing for the past month. The event went great. We had a better than expected turn out, some amazing pizza and I got a lot of great feedback on a talk that I had been preparing for the past few weeks. Click through to see the video and other details about the event.
